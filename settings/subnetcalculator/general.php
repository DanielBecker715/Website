	computer science project in the technical baccalaureate. The basic idea of this project is that you 
	can easily and quickly calculate subnets, hosts, etc. in networking. In the project, I had 1 week, 
	8 hours every day to develop this project. I successfully completed the project in March 2020 with a 
	grade of 1. I am especially proud of this challenge because I had to understand subnets before I can 
	develop a subnet calculator.";
