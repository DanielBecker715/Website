		<a class="ueberschriften">Newsletter</a>
			<span class="inhalt">
				With the following instructions we inform you about the contents of our newsletter as well as the registration, dispatch and statistical evaluation procedure and your rights of objection. By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to the receipt and the described procedures.<br><br>
				Newsletter content: We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications with promotional information (hereinafter "newsletter") only with the consent of the recipients or a legal permission. If the contents of the Newsletter are specifically described in the context of a registration, they are decisive for the consent of the users. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.<br><br>
				Double-Opt-In and logging: The registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called double-opt-in process. That is, after registration you will receive an e-mail in which you are asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with other e-mail addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time, as well as the IP address. Likewise, changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider are logged.<br><br>
				Registration data: In order to register for the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your email address. Optionally, we ask you to provide a name, for the purpose of personal address in the newsletter.<br><br>
				The dispatch of the newsletter and the associated performance measurement are based on the consent of the recipients pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, Art. 7 DSGVO in conjunction with Â§ 7 para. 2 No. 3 UWG or, if consent is not required, on the basis of our legitimate interests in direct marketing pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lt. f. DSGVO in conjunction with. Â§ 7 para 3 UWG. <br><br>
				The logging of the registration process is based on our legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Our interest is directed towards the use of a user-friendly as well as secure newsletter system that serves our business interests as well as meets the expectations of the users and further allows us to prove consent.<br><br>
				Cancellation/Revocation - You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consents. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each newsletter. We may store unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them to be able to prove consent formerly given. The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual deletion request is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of consent is confirmed at the same time.
			</span>
		<a class="ueberschriften">Newsletter - Success measurement</a>
			<span class="inhalt">
				The newsletters contain a so-called "web beacon", i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when the newsletter is opened, or if we use a shipping service provider, from their server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are initially collected. <br><br>
				This information is used for the technical improvement of the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their retrieval locations (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys also include determining whether newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our intention nor, if used, that of the dispatch service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.<br><br>
				A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire newsletter subscription must be canceled.
